# BlueMesh-Abandoned
Android library for BLE mesh networking

Sorry to disapoint, but this project, for now, is abandoned.

**What is a Classic Network?**

A classic network is composed of one server and many clients.
An example of a server - client setup is a home router.
All devices must be within range of the server.
This limits the range of the network to two factors:
* Range of the Server
* Range of the Client 
If one is too low, they cannot connect.

**What Mesh Does**

TBD
