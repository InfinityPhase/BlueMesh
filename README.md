Android library for BLE mesh networking

**What is Mesh?**
Mesh networking allows for nodes to individualy connect and disconnect from a distributed network.
This network is composed of multiple nodes, instead of one master node and many clients.
An example of a server - client setup is a hom router. All devices must be within range of the server.
This limits the range of the network to two factors:
	
	1. Range of the Server
	
	2. Range of the Client
